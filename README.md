## Overview

In this challenge, which I thought would be super easy, I found that when it comes to making responsive design I'm pretty bad. I'd be more than happy to hear some feedback about the positioning of the elements and where I could improve. Overall this doesn't look too bad but there is a lot of room for improvement

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I began with adding all the content to the site, then i proceeded to style it with css. After that I found that some of the elements didn't
format properly when the width of the screen changed so I fixed that. Next I went on to try and create the burger menu which took me a little more time
than I expected but that's because I was trying to re-invent the wheel. As soon as I took a step back and rethought everything I got back on track and found out that it was pretty easy.
Lastly it was time to fix up the rest of the media queries which I did with the best of my knowledge (which still isn't a lot).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that re-inventing the wheel isn't a good idea and that it's better to take a quick break to get your thoughts back on the right track
rather than trying to implement something that clearly isn't working. I also learned a lot about styling everything so that it works both
on desktop and mobile and I cant wait to practice everything again on a different project.

### Continued development

Thank's to this project I know that I need to practice my mobile development more because that's very important in our times.
I also need to check out how to properly style buttons.
